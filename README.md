# Final-Project | Bootcamp Data Analytics & Machine Learning


## Introduction

With this repository I want to show what I have learned during the 10 weeks full time bootcamp Data Analytics & Machine Learning at Ironhack form May till July 2020.


## Project description

Because my professional interests are in the logistics domain, I choose for a subdomain within logistics: **route optimization for order pickers in a warehouse**.

## Dataset

One of my previous employers was able to share actual data of all the movements in their warehouse of the first half year of 2020. I used that data to compare the outcome of the model I build.

## Workflow

The whole project was done in a week. I started with analyzing the dataset I received. After doing some research I decided to move forward with a Reinforcement Q learning model. I needed some attempts to get to something usefull ;-). The end version can be seen in jupyter notebook "Q_learning_4" and via "ROUTE_generator.py".
Further information can be found in the presentation "End_project_Presentation.pptx"
